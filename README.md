# WeatherNow-A-Progressive-Web-Application

In this project, a weather web app designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) has been developed.

The main page of the web application allows users to see details about live weather, as well as a 4-day preview of the week, in their current location (with the help of the Navigator Geolocation property). Moreover, the current time and date is displayed. On the same page, there is a “suggestions section” that shows, for instance, the best day to spend time outside, how the mood of the user is influenced, when to pack an umbrella, depending on the predicted weather conditions. The second page of the app allows the user to input the name of a city and get the relevant weather information.
Firstly, a web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On top of that, for the app to become a PWA (Progressive Web Application), a service worker is added, so it can be accessed offline, a web manifest so it can be installed on various devices and an open API is used to get data about weather.
